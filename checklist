chantal's debugging checklist: some tips if you're struggling to find the error in your code.

# I couldn't find a clear guide on this so I've created my own - feel free to let me know if anything needs adding and we can catch up;)

1. Anything that should be upper or lower case? Check capitalisations
2. Check spellings
3. Have you defined the string or integer?
4. = or ==?
5. Have you added a colon? ‘:’
6. Are you using the correct brackets? Or, rather, ‘parenthesis’
7. Have you used the correct indentations?
8. Are you using the correct quotation marks? Singles or doubles?
9. Have you accidentally added an extra space somewhere?
10. Did you remember to import the library at the top?
11. Is the index number you’re referencing in range?
